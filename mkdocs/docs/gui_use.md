# Graphical User Interface

To use Satlink's graphical interface, the user must run **main_window.py** via python.

From there, the user has 4 list options [File](#file), [Single Point Calculation](#single-point-calculation), 
[List Calculation](#list-calculation) and [Help](#help).

![home](..\images\home.png)

&NewLine;

## File
Same as Satlink's main classes, the graphical user interface uses 3 types of parameters: [satellite parameters](#satellite), 
[reception parameters](#reception) and [ground station parameters](#ground-station). Each one has a unique file extension and can be saved/loaded. 
The File menu lists page options to manage these files outside of calculation windows.

See [save/load dialog](#saveload-dialog-boxes) window for more details in these options and [file types](#file-types).
