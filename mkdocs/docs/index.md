SatLink is a python-based application that implements satellite link budget downlink 
calculations. Github page is [https://github.com/cfragoas/Satlink](https://github.com/cfragoas/Satlink). 

Link budget analysis consists in different aspects, from free-space and atmospheric attenuation, transmiting
and receiving system characteristics such as power, antenna gains, modulations, 
correction codes, among others.

Satlink has a GUI that can be used to simply generate results involving link attenuation, 
availability and antenna size estimation for one or multiple points. It also has functions to compute multiple 
parameters involving an earth-space downlink link-budget.
