They are: itur , Numpy , tqdm , pathos , pandas , Astropy . To use the graphical user interface, it also needs PyQt5 . One can install SatLink simply by running first_setup.py . It will install all the packages, including PyQt for the GUI usage. Alternatively, run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt If an IDE, like PyCharm , is being used, it will automatically detect the requirements file and ask to install the packages (including PyQt). Lastly, the packages can be installed individually.
